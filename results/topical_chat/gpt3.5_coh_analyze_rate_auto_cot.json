( jazz or otherwise ? ) \n that is interesting . i have n't been to a live concert recently , but i want to many when i was younger . most of them were in smaller venues though . \n it 's been awhile since i 've been to any as well . got a friend of mine he 's big into the ramones and seen them in concert a few times . get this , they 've played a total of 2,263 concerts , touring almost non - stop for over twenty years . now that 's dedication to your music ! \n i can only imagine how exhausting that must be as well . sometimes i think it would be cool to travel to some of the ancient amphitheaters to see what they 're like . pink floyd once recorded a live concert with no audience in a roman one in pompeii \n wonder why the did it without an audience ? pretty sure people would have shown if they 're heard about it . must be one of those \" eccentric rock and roll musician \" things . wonder how a concert would sound held in an old amphitheater ... \n it might be because an audience would affect the sound and acoustics in the theater . there 's another ancient amphitheater in croatia that 's used for concerts . those romans really liked their theaters \n well , theaters were a big event at the time , plays , gladiator events , concerts .. you got ta remember , they did n't have the internet back then , so they had to do something for entertainment . :) so , what was the last concert you ever attended ? \n now that i think about it , i went to one a little over a year ago around christmastime , so most of the songs were christmas songs . the venue was fairly big , but not as big as ones like where the big name artists perform . it was good still , unlike the 2002 creed concert that was bad enough for concert goers to file a lawsuit \n\n\n\nCorresponding Fact:\n\nin 2002 a creed concert was so bad that four concert goers filed a lawsuit against the band\n\n\nResponse:\n\nyeah i heard about that ! i wonder how bad that concert must have been .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"Analysis:\" to analyze the given example regarding the evaluation criteria as concise as possible, and then give the numeric rating on the next line by \"Rating:):\n- Coherence:\n",
