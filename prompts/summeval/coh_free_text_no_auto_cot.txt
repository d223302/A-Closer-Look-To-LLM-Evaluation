You will be given one summary written for a news article.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby "the summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."


Example:


Source Text:

{{Document}}

Summary:

{{Summary}}


Question:
How coherent is the summary? That is, how well do the sentences in the summary fit together? (On a scale of 1-5, with 1 being the lowest)
