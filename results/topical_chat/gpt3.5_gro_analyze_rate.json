[ the nfl teams that have serious reasons to worry , versus the ones that do n't ] mack , while still with the raiders , had been holding out , seeking such a deal . the raiders did n't want to give it to him . they have a $ 125 million quarterback in carr . they have a $ 100 million coach in gruden . they drew the line at handing out another mammoth deal , not wanting to further strain their budget or push the boundaries of the salary cap . they regarded the king 's ransom of draft picks put forth by the bears , including a pair of first - rounders , as an offer they could n't refuse . in truth , they could have refused it .\n\n\nResponse:\n\nit 's hard to pick a specific team . i guess i would have to say the raiders .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (Answer by starting with \"Analysis:\" to analyze the given example regarding the evaluation criteria as concise as possible, and then give the numeric rating on the next line by \"Rating:):\n- Groundedness:\n",
